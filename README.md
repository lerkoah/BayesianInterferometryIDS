# Bayesian Interferometry Repo

This repository has the Bayesia side for the Interferometry project from *Information and Decision System* Laboratory (Electrical Engineering Department, Universidad de Chile).

Here we going to implement the proposed model using pymc3 as a solver.

## Installing PYMC3
For installing correctly PYMC3 we have to pre-install the following libraries:
For optimization in Theano:
```bash
dnf install gcc-c++
```
Install Tkinter
```bash
dnf install tkinter
```
```bash
pip install pymc3
```
