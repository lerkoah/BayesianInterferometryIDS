# Bayesian Interferometry PyTorch

This repository has the Bayesian side for the Interferometry project from *Information and Decision System* Laboratory of Electrical Engineering Department, Universidad de Chile and Grupo de Aprendizaje Máquinas, Inferencia y Señales.

Here we going to implement the proposed model using pytorch as a solver.

## Installing pytorch
For installing correctly PYMC3 we have to pre-install the following libraries:

CUDA only works with GCC versions 4.9 or lower.

For installing pytorch you have to follow the steps in ``http://pytorch.org/``. We use the following bash command:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith
```
